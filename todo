Broken, the refresh/start logic doesn't work.
unpause takes to long to restart
setup a way to clear local storage
right now it keeps track of time on reload, page change, but will start from where it left off on exit (which is most likely fine)
setup the build properly, have the server bundled and something that runs off the dist/ content
Memory leak, changing page while time is running
